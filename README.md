## AI-Based Generation of Synthetic Contrast-Enhanced Mammography Images

Conventional mammography, despite its widespread use, has limited sensitivity and carries a risk of missing lesions. Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) offers a more powerful supplement, enhancing the screening and diagnosis of breast lesions and treatment response assessment. However, it requires increased radiation exposure and the use of contrast agents. To address these limitations, we propose a deep learning-based Recombined Image Synthesis System (RISS) that generates high-fidelity recombined images from low-energy images. It integrates the contextual awareness of vision transformers, the precision of convolutional operators, and the realism conferred by adversarial learning, aiming to reduce CEM radiation dose and apply it to mammography to eliminate the need for contrast agents. RISS was trained and tested on a large-scale dataset comprising 113,351 images from 13,335 patients across six hospitals in China, two international public cohorts, and a prospective clinical trial population (Chinese Clinical Trial: ChiCTR2400091510). RISS outperformed classical models and an ablated variant in quantitative evaluations. The system demonstrated superior image fidelity, achieving peak signal-to-noise ratios of 29.71â€“32.68 and structural similarity indices of 0.90â€“0.98 (P < 0.05). Radiologistsâ€™ evaluations revealed high consistency between real and synthetic recombined images (P > 0.05). In the diagnostic task, synthetic images achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of â‰¥ 0.80 , with a kappa coefficient of 0.81 to assess neoadjuvant chemotherapy response. When extended to mammography, RISS eliminated the need for contrast agents and the associated 20â€“30 minutes of preparation, injection, and observation. This capability significantly enhanced diagnostic sensitivity and reduced unnecessary biopsies (P < 0.05) compared to mammography alone. These findings highlight RISS as a potential tool for improving breast cancer screening and diagnosis while mitigating radiation exposure and contrast-related risks.

## Dataset
Before the CEM images were input into the RISS, an algorithm based on automatic threshold segmentation (Otsu) was implemented to isolate the mammary gland from the background. Following the cropping of the breast area, the images were  unified to a resolution of 512Ã—1024 pixels and normalized. To create a two-dimensional image suitable for input into the generator network, the low-energy image and recombined image for each view, along with all-zero images (CC and MLO views), were assigned to the red, green, and blue channels of the RGB image, respectively. During the subsequent network training process, the network was guided to generate a recombined image for the green channel based on the low-energy image in the red channel.
